    body: '<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. In this part, we will introduce the basics of CSS and explore how selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling.</p>\n<h2>What is CSS?</h2>\n<p>CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It allows you to control layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, providing a consistent look across your website.</p>\n<h2>CSS Syntax</h2>\n<p>CSS is written by specifying a selector followed by a block of styles. A typical CSS rule looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>selector {\n  property: value;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>selector</code> is used to target HTML elements, and the <code>property</code> defines the style that will be applied. The <code>value</code> specifies what the property should be set to.</p>\n<h2>CSS Selectors</h2>\n<p>Selectors are used to "select" which HTML elements you want to style. Some common selectors include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Type Selector:</strong> Targets elements by their tag name. Example: <code>p</code> for all paragraphs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Class Selector:</strong> Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Example: <code>.class-name</code>.</li>\n  <li><strong>ID Selector:</strong> Targets elements with a specific ID. Example: <code>#id-name</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these selectors, you can apply different styles to various elements on your web page.</p>\n<h2>Applying Styles with CSS</h2>\n<p>Let’s see a basic example of applying CSS to an HTML page:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;\n  p {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n  .highlight {\n    background-color: yellow;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, all &lt;p&gt; elements will have blue text, and any element with the class <code>highlight</code> will have a yellow background.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>CSS selectors allow you to target specific elements on a web page for styling.

In this article, we’ll break down the components of the box model and show you how to control element dimensions.</p>\n<h2>The Box Model Explained</h2>\n<p>Every HTML element is essentially a rectangular box made up of four parts:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Content:</strong> The actual content of the box, such as text or an image.</li>\n  <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Space between the content and the border. Padding is included in the box size but doesn’t affect other elements.</li>\n  <li><strong>Border:</strong> Surrounds the padding and content, and can have a specified width and style.</li>\n  <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Space outside the border, used to create distance between elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example of the Box Model</h2>\n<p>Here’s a basic CSS example demonstrating the box model:</p>\n<pre><code>div {\n  width: 200px;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border: 2px solid black;\n  margin: 20px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code creates a box with a width of 200px, 10px padding inside the box, a 2px solid border, and 20px margin outside the border.</p>\n<h2>Box Sizing</h2>\n<p>By default, the width and height properties of an element only include the content. Padding and borders are added outside of that. To change this behavior, you can use <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>, which includes padding and borders in the element’s specified width and height.</p>\n<pre><code>div {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Understanding the CSS box model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements on a web page.

Unlike Flexbox, which is primarily one-dimensional, CSS Grid gives you more control over both the horizontal and vertical alignment of items. In this article, we’ll cover the basics of CSS Grid and how to implement it in your designs.</p>\n<h2>Setting Up a Grid Container</h2>\n<p>To use CSS Grid, first define a grid container by applying <code>display: grid;</code> to an element. This container will hold your grid items.</p>\n<pre><code>.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-template-rows: auto;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This example creates a grid with three equal-width columns, where each column takes up 1 fraction (1fr) of the available space.</p>\n<h2>Positioning Grid Items</h2>\n<p>You can place items into specific grid cells using the <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> properties. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>.item1 {\n  grid-column: 1 / 3;\n  grid-row: 1 / 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code places the item1 element across the first two columns and spans one row.</p>\n<h2>Grid Gap and Alignment</h2>\n<p>CSS Grid also allows you to control the spacing between grid items using the <code>grid-gap</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>.grid-container {\n  grid-gap: 10px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a 10px gap between all the grid items. You can also align items using <code>align-items</code> and <code>justify-items</code> for vertical and horizontal alignment.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>CSS Grid provides more control and flexibility for creating complex layouts compared to Flexbox.

    tags: ["JavaScript", "Asynchronous JavaScript", "Promises", "Async/Await"],
    body: "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In JavaScript, many operations like fetching data from a server are asynchronous, meaning they don’t block the rest of the code from executing. This article covers how to work with asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and the <code>async/await</code> syntax.</p>\n<h2>Callbacks</h2>\n<p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after an asynchronous task completes:</p>\n<pre><code>function fetchData(callback) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    callback('Data loaded');\n  }, 1000);\n}\n\nfetchData((data) => {\n  console.log(data); // Outputs: Data loaded\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Promises</h2>\n<p>Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code. A promise represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never:</p>\n<pre><code>const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve('Data loaded');\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\npromise.then((data) => {\n  console.log(data); // Outputs: Data loaded\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Async/Await</h2>\n<p>Async functions make working with promises even easier. You can write asynchronous code that looks synchronous using the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords:</p>\n<pre><code>async function fetchData() {\n  const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve('Data loaded'), 1000);\n  });\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\nfetchData(); // Outputs: Data loaded\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Asynchronous programming is crucial in JavaScript for handling time-consuming tasks like API requests. By using callbacks, promises, and async/await, you can write clean and efficient asynchronous code. In the next part, we’ll dive into error handling and debugging techniques in JavaScript.</p>",

    tags: ["JavaScript", "Error Handling", "Debugging", "try-catch"],
    body: "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Errors are inevitable in programming, but JavaScript provides mechanisms to handle and debug them efficiently. In this article, we’ll explore error handling techniques using <code>try-catch</code> and how to use browser developer tools to debug your JavaScript code.</p>\n<h2>Error Handling with try-catch</h2>\n<p>The <code>try-catch</code> statement allows you to handle exceptions gracefully. Any code that might throw an error can be placed inside a <code>try</code> block, and if an error occurs, the <code>catch</code> block will handle it:</p>\n<pre><code>try {\n  let result = 10 / 0;\n  console.log(result);\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log('Error caught:', error.message);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Throwing Custom Errors</h2>\n<p>You can also throw your own errors using the <code>throw</code> statement:</p>\n<pre><code>function checkAge(age) {\n  if (age < 18) {\n    throw new Error('You must be at least 18 years old');\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  checkAge(15);\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error.message); // Outputs: You must be at least 18 years old\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Debugging with Developer Tools</h2>\n<p>Modern browsers come with built-in developer tools that allow you to inspect your code and find issues. To debug your JavaScript code:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Open the browser’s developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting <em>Inspect</em>).</li>\n  <li>Go to the <em>Console</em> tab to see error messages and logs.</li>\n  <li>Use breakpoints in the <em>Sources</em> tab to pause the code and step through it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Error handling and debugging are critical skills for any JavaScript developer. By using <code>try-catch</code> for errors and the browser’s developer tools for debugging, you can effectively manage issues in your code.
